This challenge involves a file that is corrupted. The file type can still be fairly easily obtained by analyzing the exif data. They it should become apperent that its a jpeg file (or whatever file is corrupted). Then the first 2 bytes are changed. This can be realized by looking up the file signature of different file types. Once the bytes are changed back and the signature correct, the image will display.

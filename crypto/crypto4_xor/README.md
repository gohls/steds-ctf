This problem requires to convert the hex string "130E021B000D1A021244080A00080F4516184908185946001A03520D151C" to binary. Like convert the passphrase "taco tuesday every day all day" to binary. XOR the hex string against the passphrase (the passphrase is purposefully left as a formate. While XOR eiter way my work for this challenge, in a later challenge it may be important to cycle the passphrase rather then the hex str.) The result will be "goat yoga is my daily favorite" when converting binary back to string type.

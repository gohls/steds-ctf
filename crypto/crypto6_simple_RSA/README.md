This is a simple RSA challenge in which n and p are known, but q is not. Since qp = n, and n and p are given, thus  q = n/p. e is also provided, so to find d take the modular multiplicative inverse of e and phi. Now it's just a matter of plugging in the numbers. The result may output the numerical representation of a string, so converting the numbers into their character representation will reveal a string=flag.

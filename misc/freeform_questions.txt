The idea behind these kinds of challenges is to have students implement certain data structures
and then show one of us for approval. They have to explain the code to us to ensure that they 
have a strong grasp on what's going on, and didn't simply copy/paste.

Examples:
In your chosen language of choice:
*  Implement a stack with push and pop functions
*  Implement bubble sort
*  Implement selection sort
*  Implement insertion sort
*  Implement merge sort
*  Implement quick sort
*  Make a recursive function
*  Implement xyz...etc
